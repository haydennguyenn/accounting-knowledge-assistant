# Alfa Focus Knowledge Assistant

An internal, citation-first knowledge assistant for **Alfa Focus**, a specialist SMSF administration practice in South Melbourne. Built as the RMIT COSC2408 Programming Project 1 capstone.

The problem: Australian superannuation rules change constantly - 1 July 2026 alone brought Division 296, payday super, and an indexed transfer balance cap - and firm-specific procedure lives in senior heads rather than in writing. Accountants lose time re-deriving answers, and two staff can give a referring planner two different answers.

The assistant answers two kinds of question and keeps them strictly separate:

- **What does the law require?** Grounded in ATO guidance, rulings, legislation, TPB and APESB, cited to a source you can open.
- **How does Alfa Focus do this?** Grounded in the firm's own procedures, labelled as firm convention rather than law.

Every answer carries resolvable citations and an explicit income year. It assists a registered tax agent; it never signs off.

> **Status: pre-client-meeting.** The client has not been met. Everything in [`docs/CLIENT-BRIEF.md`](docs/CLIENT-BRIEF.md) is open-source research carrying explicit confidence markers. Do not quote a `MEDIUM` or `LOW` fact to the client as settled.

## Documentation

Read in this order. Each is written to be read on its own, but the design decisions only make sense after the domain primer.

| Doc | What it answers |
|---|---|
| [`docs/CLIENT-BRIEF.md`](docs/CLIENT-BRIEF.md) | Who Alfa Focus actually is. **They are an SMSF specialist, not a general tax consultancy** - read this before assuming scope |
| [`docs/DOMAIN-PRIMER.md`](docs/DOMAIN-PRIMER.md) | Australian SMSF practice for a team with no accounting background; what is changing in 2026; the professional-obligation constraints that drive the architecture |
| [`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) | Numbered, testable requirements: chatbot behaviour, file upload, data handling, edge cases. What the build is held to |
| [`docs/RAG-DESIGN.md`](docs/RAG-DESIGN.md) | The two-corpus split, the chunk schema, hybrid + temporal retrieval, and **which file in this repo owns each piece** |
| [`docs/PROMPTS.md`](docs/PROMPTS.md) | The system prompt, refusal templates, query-understanding prompt. Source of truth for `app/rag/generator.py` |
| [`docs/EVALUATION.md`](docs/EVALUATION.md) | Benchmark taxonomy, 28 seed questions, metrics and gates, LLM-judge design, what `/testing` must do |
| [`docs/CLIENT-MEETING-QUESTIONS.md`](docs/CLIENT-MEETING-QUESTIONS.md) | The 14 questions that change the build, ranked |
| [`docs/GIT-WORKFLOW.md`](docs/GIT-WORKFLOW.md) | Branch naming, commit format, PR and CI requirements |
| [`docs/DATABASE.md`](docs/DATABASE.md) | PostgreSQL + pgvector setup, BGE-M3 embeddings, schema reference, connection guide |

## Design principles

These are enforced in code and checked by the evaluation suite, not aspirational:

1. **No citation, no claim.** If retrieval finds nothing, the assistant escalates rather than guesses. A confident unsourced answer is the worst possible output for a regulated client.
2. **Every volatile claim is scoped to an income year.** Undated tax advice is wrong advice.
3. **Law and firm practice are never blended in one sentence.** Separate labelled sections, attributed per claim.
4. **No client identifiers, no member-specific figures.** The assistant answers rules questions. Client data stays out by construction.
5. **Deterministic checks beat judged ones.** Citation resolution is a lookup and an HTTP check, gated at 100% with no exceptions.

### Layer overview

- **`routes/`** — HTTP handlers. Each route renders a template or delegates to `services/`/`rag/` — no business logic lives here directly.
- **`chainlit/`** — the chat interface. `on_message` is where a user's question enters the RAG pipeline via `rag/`.
- **`services/`** — logic that isn't HTTP- or chat-specific: document lifecycle and file storage. Keeps `routes/` from growing bloated handlers.
- **`rag/`** — the pipeline itself, split by responsibility (embed → retrieve → generate) so each piece can be tested and swapped independently. `retriever.py` is the highest-value file in the repo: retrieval, not generation, is where RAG systems actually fail.
- **`db/`** — the persistence layer. `models.py` and `schema.sql` mirror each other — update both if the schema changes. The proposed schema is in [`docs/RAG-DESIGN.md`](docs/RAG-DESIGN.md) section 4.

### Database

**Postgres 14+ with pgvector** hosted on **Supabase**. The free tier provides 500MB database storage and 1GB file storage — sufficient for ~1,400 documents with embeddings.

**Why Supabase + pgvector?**
- Single system for metadata filtering, full-text search, and vector similarity
- One SQL query can filter by effective dates, match statutory identifiers, and rank by semantic distance
- No sync lag between separate vector and metadata stores
- Free tier includes automatic backups and point-in-time recovery

- **Dev**: Local development, seeded with test documents (`SUPABASE_DB_URL` in `.env`)

See [`docs/DATABASE.md`](docs/DATABASE.md) for schema details, connection setup, and BGE-M3 embedding integration.

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+ (macOS/Linux)
- Active Supabase project with connection string
- Hugging Face account with API token

### Initial Setup

1. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies:**

```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure environment variables:**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required variables:
```bash
# Database
SUPABASE_DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:[password]@db.[project-ref].supabase.co:5432/postgres

# Embedding model
HF_TOKEN=hf_your_token_here

# LLM providers (choose one or both)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
GROQ_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b
```

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all variables and [`docs/DATABASE.md`](docs/DATABASE.md) for database setup.

### Running the Application

Chainlit is mounted into FastAPI at `/chat` (see `app/main.py`). Start the server from the repository root:

**Development (local access only):**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

**LAN access (testing from other devices):**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Access the Application

| Endpoint | URL | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Chat interface | `http://localhost:8000/chat` | Main Chainlit UI |
| Document upload | `http://localhost:8000/upload` | Bulk document ingestion |
| Evaluation | `http://localhost:8000/testing` | Benchmark runner |
| API docs | `http://localhost:8000/docs` | FastAPI Swagger UI |

For LAN access, replace `localhost` with your machine's local IP address.

### Testing

The test suite uses `pytest` and verifies database connections, schema existence, Hugging Face embedding generation, and environment configuration.

Make sure your virtual environment is active and `.env` has valid credentials before running tests:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Run all tests:**
```bash
pytest -v
```

**Run specific test modules:**
```bash
pytest tests/db/{TEST FILE} -v
```

```bash
# Example: running the env loading tests
pytest tests/db/test_env.py -v
```

**Useful pytest flags:**
- `-v`: Verbose output showing each test status
- `-s`: Print stdout messages (useful for viewing embedding dimensions and table lists)
- `-k <pattern>`: Run tests matching a keyword (e.g. `pytest -k "connection"`)

### Troubleshooting

**"Module not found: app"**
- Ensure you're running from the project root, not inside `app/`
- Use `python -m` syntax: `python -m app.main` or specify the full module path: `uvicorn app.main:app`

**"uvicorn: command not found"**
- Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Or use the direct path: `./.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

**Database connection errors**
- Verify `SUPABASE_DB_URL` in `.env` matches your Supabase dashboard
- Check that pgvector extension is enabled (see [`docs/DATABASE.md`](docs/DATABASE.md))
- Supabase pauses inactive projects after 7 days — wake it by visiting the dashboard

**Production deployment:**
- Run Uvicorn behind a reverse proxy (nginx)
- Use a process manager (systemd, supervisord)
- Never run as root or bind to privileged ports directly

## Contributing

`main` is protected. Branch, PR, squash merge — see [`docs/GIT-WORKFLOW.md`](docs/GIT-WORKFLOW.md) for the enforced branch and commit naming rules.

Two additional rules for this project:

- **A prompt change is a behaviour change.** Edit [`docs/PROMPTS.md`](docs/PROMPTS.md) and `generator.py` in the same PR, re-run the benchmark, and put the before/after per-class scores in the PR description.
- **A schema change touches two files.** `models.py` and `schema.sql` must stay mirrored.

## Known gaps in the scaffold

Tracked here so nobody assumes they work:

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` does not deploy. It contains a commit-message check. Rename it to `commit-message.yml` or make it deploy.
- `app/rag/embedder.py` is empty — BGE-M3 embedding implementation pending (see [`docs/DATABASE.md`](docs/DATABASE.md) for integration guide).
- `app/rag/retriever.py` and `app/rag/generator.py` are incomplete — RAG pipeline scaffolded but not functional.
- `mlflow` is not in `requirements.txt` — the evaluation design in [`docs/EVALUATION.md`](docs/EVALUATION.md) assumes it.
- `ci.yml` has a commented-out `pytest` step — that is where the evaluation gates hook in.
